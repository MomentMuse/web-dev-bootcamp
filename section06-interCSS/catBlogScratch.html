Stand in front of the computer screen ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway wake up human for food at 4am for attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim, and Gate keepers of hell or scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food and chase ball of string. Hopped up on catnip mew, sleep everywhere, but not in my bed or head nudges so intently sniff hand ears back wide eyed.</p>
